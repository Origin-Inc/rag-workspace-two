# ðŸ”´ IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED - Connection Pool Error

## The Problem
Your `connection_limit=1` is too low. Prisma needs multiple connections and you're limiting it to just 1!

## Fix in Vercel Dashboard NOW

### Update DATABASE_URL to:
```
postgresql://postgres.PROJECT-REDACTED:PASSWORD-REDACTED@aws-1-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=30
```

Changes:
- `connection_limit=1` â†’ `connection_limit=10` 
- Added `pool_timeout=30` (increases timeout from 10s to 30s)

### Keep DIRECT_URL as is:
```
postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD-REDACTED@db.PROJECT-REDACTED.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

## Why This Will Fix It

According to Prisma documentation:
- **DO NOT use `connection_limit=1`** with external poolers like PgBouncer
- Prisma needs multiple connections for concurrent operations
- Your current setup only allows 1 connection, causing immediate timeouts

## Alternative If Still Broken

If the above doesn't work, try this DATABASE_URL instead (with pool_timeout=0):
```
postgresql://postgres.PROJECT-REDACTED:PASSWORD-REDACTED@aws-1-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=15&pool_timeout=0
```

This removes the timeout entirely (queries wait indefinitely for a connection).

## Verification Steps

After updating and redeploying:
1. Try to sign in - should work immediately
2. Check no more "connection pool timeout" errors
3. Test file uploads

## Long-term Solution

If issues persist after this fix:
1. Consider upgrading to Supabase Pro for more connections
2. Or switch to using direct connection (bypass pooler) if your app has low traffic
