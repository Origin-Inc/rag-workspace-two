 */

console.error(`
‚ùå BLOCKED: Direct 'prisma db push' is not allowed!

üìã Why?
- No migration history
- No rollback capability
- No review process
- Destructive changes without tracking

‚úÖ Use migrations instead:

Development:
  npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_name

Production (via Vercel):
  Migrations auto-deploy on git push

Emergency (local testing only):
  npx prisma db push (will be blocked by this script)

To bypass (NOT RECOMMENDED):
  npx prisma db push --skip-generate
