# File Persistence Fix Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed (Just Now)

### 1. Database Schema Fixed
- **Problem**: `parquet_url` column was missing in production database
- **Solution**: Applied migration to add the column
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Column now exists

### 2. RLS Policy Fixed

- **Solution**: Fixed type casting in RLS policies
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Policies updated

### 3. Environment Variables Fixed (By You)
- **DATABASE_URL**: Changed to port 5432 (session pooler) ✅
- **SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY**: Updated with correct key ✅
- **APP_URL**: Updated to actual Vercel URL ✅

## 🧪 Test Now

The deployment is being triggered by the push. Once deployed (1-2 minutes), test:

### Quick Test:
1. **Refresh your browser** on the Vercel app
2. **Upload a CSV file** 
3. **Check console** - Should see NO errors about:
   - `parquet_url` column missing
   - RLS policy violations
   - 500 errors on API calls

### Full Persistence Test:
1. **In Chrome**: Upload a CSV file
2. **Check Success Messages**:
   - "File uploaded to Supabase storage" ✅
   - "Table created with X rows" ✅
   - "Parquet exported and uploaded" ✅ (should work now!)
   - "File metadata saved to database" ✅ (should work now!)
3. **Sign out** and close Chrome
4. **Open Firefox/Safari** in incognito mode
5. **Sign in** with same account
6. **Navigate to same page**
7. **Files should auto-load!** 🎉

## 📊 What to Look For

### Success Indicators:
- No 500 errors in console
- No "column does not exist" errors
- No "RLS policy violation" errors
- Files persist across browsers
- Sync status shows "✓ Synced"

### In Supabase Dashboard:
Check Storage → Browse:
- `user-uploads` → Has your CSV files
- `duckdb-tables` → Has JSON exports (should work now!)

## 🚀 Current Status
