# üîÑ FORCE VERCEL TO REBUILD WITH NEW CONNECTION SETTINGS

## The Problem
Vercel is caching the old Prisma Client with `connection_limit: 3`. Even though you updated DATABASE_URL, the cached client still uses old settings.

## Solution: Force Complete Rebuild

### Option 1: Redeploy with Clear Cache (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Go to your project
3. Click **"Deployments"** tab
4. Find the latest deployment
5. Click the **three dots menu** (...)
6. Select **"Redeploy"**
7. **CHECK THE BOX: "Use existing Build Cache"** - Make sure it's UNCHECKED!
8. Click **"Redeploy"**

This forces Vercel to:
- Clear all cached dependencies
- Regenerate Prisma Client with new DATABASE_URL
- Use the new connection_limit=10 setting

### Option 2: Trigger via Git (Just Added)
I've added `"postinstall": "prisma generate"` to package.json.
Push this change to trigger a new deployment that will regenerate Prisma Client:

```bash
git push origin development
```

### Option 3: Manual Trigger with Different Commit
If Option 1 doesn't work, make a dummy change to force rebuild:
1. Add a space to any file
2. Commit and push
3. This forces a new deployment

## Verify After Deployment

Check that the error changes from:
- ‚ùå "connection limit: 3" 
- ‚úÖ "connection limit: 10"

If it still shows "3", the cache wasn't cleared properly.

## Why This Happens

Vercel aggressively caches node_modules to speed up builds. But this means:
- Prisma Client gets cached with old DATABASE_URL
- Changes to DATABASE_URL don't regenerate the client
- The old connection_limit stays in the cached binary

## Permanent Fix

The `postinstall` script I added ensures Prisma Client regenerates on every deployment going forward.

**Do Option 1 NOW - Redeploy with cache cleared!**
