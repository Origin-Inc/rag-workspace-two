# Task ID: 10
# Title: Performance Optimization and Production Readiness
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement performance optimizations, monitoring, testing suite, and prepare the application for Supabase production deployment
# Details:
1. Implement React virtualization for large lists using react-window:
```typescript
import { FixedSizeList } from 'react-window';
<FixedSizeList height={600} itemCount={50000} itemSize={35}>
  {Row}
</FixedSizeList>
```
2. Leverage Supabase's built-in connection pooling and PgBouncer configuration
3. Utilize Supabase's built-in caching with proper cache headers:
```typescript
// Use Supabase's built-in caching
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('table')
  .select('*')
  .abortSignal(signal); // Automatic caching handled by Supabase
```
4. Configure Supabase CDN for static assets and storage buckets
5. Implement comprehensive test suite:
   - Unit tests with Jest/Vitest (80% coverage)
   - Integration tests for Supabase functions and RLS policies
   - E2E tests with Playwright
   - Performance tests with k6 for Supabase endpoints
6. Set up monitoring with Supabase Analytics and custom metrics:
```typescript
// Use Supabase Analytics
import { analytics } from '@supabase/analytics-js';
analytics.track('api_request', { duration: ms, endpoint: '/api/data' });
```
7. Deploy Edge Functions using Supabase CLI
8. Write deployment documentation for Supabase hosting
9. Implement health checks using Supabase Edge Functions
10. Configure auto-scaling with Supabase's infrastructure

# Test Strategy:
Run full test suite with >80% coverage. Load test Supabase endpoints with 100 concurrent users and 50k row databases. Verify Supabase Analytics captures all metrics. Test Edge Function deployment pipeline. Verify Supabase's built-in monitoring and alerting work correctly.
