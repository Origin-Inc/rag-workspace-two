# Dependencies: 14 (Not found), 11 (Not found), 6 (Not found)
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the existing block system with advanced features including grid-based positioning, cross-block interactions, block collections, theming, permissions, version control, transformations, custom SDK, marketplace, real-time collaboration, performance optimization, responsive layouts, and import/export functionality
# Details:
1. Implement grid-based positioning system for blocks:
```typescript
interface BlockGridSystem {
  gridSize: { columns: 12, rows: 'auto' };
  snapToGrid: boolean;
  gridGap: number;
  breakpoints: {
    mobile: { columns: 4, threshold: 768 };
    tablet: { columns: 8, threshold: 1024 };
    desktop: { columns: 12, threshold: 1440 };
  };
}

interface EnhancedBlockPosition extends BlockPosition {
  gridArea?: string; // CSS Grid area definition
  flexOrder?: number;
  responsivePositions?: Map<string, BlockPosition>;
}
```

2. Create cross-block interaction system in Supabase:
```sql
CREATE TABLE block_references (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  source_block_id UUID REFERENCES blocks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  target_block_id UUID REFERENCES blocks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  reference_type TEXT CHECK (reference_type IN ('link', 'embed', 'sync', 'formula')),
  reference_data JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE synced_blocks (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  master_block_id UUID REFERENCES blocks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sync_group_id UUID NOT NULL,
  sync_properties TEXT[] DEFAULT ARRAY['content', 'style'],
  last_synced_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

3. Implement block collections and grouping:
```typescript
interface BlockCollection {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  blocks: string[];
  layout: 'stack' | 'grid' | 'masonry' | 'carousel';
  metadata: {
    collapsed?: boolean;
    locked?: boolean;
    template?: boolean;
  };
}

class BlockCollectionManager {
  async createCollection(blocks: Block[]): Promise<BlockCollection>
  async addToCollection(collectionId: string, blockId: string): Promise<void>
  async removeFromCollection(collectionId: string, blockId: string): Promise<void>
  async applyCollectionTemplate(templateId: string): Promise<BlockCollection>
}
```

4. Build consistent theming system:
```typescript
interface BlockTheme {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  variables: {
    colors: Record<string, string>;
    typography: Record<string, FontStyle>;
    spacing: Record<string, number>;
    borders: Record<string, BorderStyle>;
    shadows: Record<string, string>;
  };
  blockOverrides: Map<BlockType, Partial<BlockStyle>>;
}

class ThemeManager {
  async applyTheme(themeId: string, blockIds: string[]): Promise<void>
  async createCustomTheme(base: BlockTheme): Promise<BlockTheme>
  async exportTheme(themeId: string): Promise<ThemeExport>

  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  permission_level TEXT CHECK (permission_level IN ('view', 'comment', 'edit', 'admin')),
  granted_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  granted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  UNIQUE(block_id, user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE block_access_tokens (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  block_id UUID REFERENCES blocks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  permission_level TEXT,
  max_uses INTEGER,
  used_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

6. Add version control and history tracking:
```typescript
interface BlockVersion {
  id: string;
  blockId: string;
  version: number;
  content: any;
  metadata: {
    author: string;
    timestamp: Date;
    changeDescription?: string;
    diff?: JsonDiff;
  };
}

class BlockVersionControl {
  async saveVersion(blockId: string, content: any): Promise<BlockVersion>

  private realtimeChannel: RealtimeChannel;
  private awareness: AwarenessProtocol;
  
  async joinSession(blockId: string): Promise<void> {
    this.realtimeChannel = supabase.channel(`block:${blockId}`);
    
    this.realtimeChannel
      .on('presence', { event: 'sync' }, () => this.syncPresence())
      .on('broadcast', { event: 'cursor' }, (payload) => this.updateCursor(payload))
      .on('broadcast', { event: 'selection' }, (payload) => this.updateSelection(payload))
      .on('broadcast', { event: 'edit' }, (payload) => this.applyEdit(payload))
      .subscribe();
  }
  
  async broadcastEdit(operation: EditOperation): Promise<void>
  async resolveConflict(local: Edit, remote: Edit): Promise<Edit>

  async optimizeBlock(block: Block): Promise<OptimizedBlock> {
    return {
      ...block,
      render: this.memoizeRender(block),
      data: await this.compressData(block.data),
      assets: await this.optimizeAssets(block.assets)
    };
  }
  
  virtualizeBlockList(blocks: Block[]): VirtualizedList
  implementProgressiveLoading(blocks: Block[]): ProgressiveLoader
  enableOffscreenRendering(blockId: string): void

  async convertFormat(blocks: Block[], from: string, to: string): Promise<Block[]>
  validateImport(data: any): ValidationResult
}
```

14. Integrate with Supabase Edge Functions for advanced processing:
```typescript
// supabase/functions/block-processor/index.ts
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts'

serve(async (req) => {
  const { blockId, operation } = await req.json();
  
  switch(operation) {
    case 'optimize':
      return optimizeBlockContent(blockId);
    case 'transform':
      return transformBlockType(blockId, req.targetType);
    case 'analyze':
      return analyzeBlockComplexity(blockId);
    case 'export':
      return generateBlockExport(blockId, req.format);
  }
});
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test grid-based positioning by creating blocks with different grid positions and verifying they render correctly at various breakpoints, with proper snap-to-grid behavior and responsive adjustments.

2. Verify cross-block interactions by creating linked blocks, testing reference updates propagate correctly, synced blocks update simultaneously, and formula references calculate properly across blocks.

3. Test block collections by grouping multiple blocks, verifying collection operations (add/remove/reorder), testing different layout modes (stack/grid/masonry), and ensuring template collections can be instantiated correctly.

4. Validate theming system by applying themes to blocks, testing theme variable inheritance, verifying block-specific overrides work, and ensuring theme exports/imports maintain consistency.

5. Test permissions by setting different access levels for users, verifying view/edit/admin permissions are enforced, testing access tokens work with proper expiration, and ensuring permission inheritance from parent blocks.

6. Verify version control by making changes to blocks and checking version history, testing revert functionality, comparing version diffs, and ensuring branch merging works correctly.

7. Test block transformations between different types (text→list, table→cards), verifying data preservation during transformation, testing bulk transformations, and ensuring transformation validation prevents data loss.

8. Validate custom block SDK by creating a custom block using the SDK, testing all lifecycle hooks, verifying data persistence, and ensuring custom blocks integrate with all system features.

9. Test marketplace functionality by publishing a custom block, searching and installing marketplace blocks, verifying compatibility checks, and testing version updates.

10. Verify real-time collaboration by having multiple users edit the same block, testing cursor and selection synchronization, verifying conflict resolution, and ensuring presence awareness works.

11. Test performance optimizations with 1000+ blocks on a page, measuring render times, verifying lazy loading and virtualization work, and testing memory usage stays within acceptable limits.

12. Validate responsive layouts by testing blocks at mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints, verifying container queries work, testing reflow on window resize, and ensuring touch interactions work on mobile.

13. Test import/export by exporting blocks in various formats (JSON, HTML, Markdown), importing from different sources, verifying data integrity after round-trip import/export, and testing format conversions.

14. Integration tests for the complete enhanced block system, including creating a complex page with 50+ interconnected blocks, testing all features work together without conflicts, and verifying Supabase Edge Functions process blocks correctly.
