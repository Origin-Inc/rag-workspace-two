# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Development Environment and Project Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project with Remix framework, configure TypeScript, set up PostgreSQL with pgvector extension, Redis, and create the base project structure with all necessary dependencies
# Details:
1. Initialize Remix app with Vite: `npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/vite-express`
2. Install core dependencies: `npm install react@18.2.0 @remix-run/node@^2.16.8 @remix-run/react@^2.16.8 @remix-run/serve@^2.16.8`
3. Configure TypeScript 5.1.6 with strict mode in tsconfig.json
4. Install PostgreSQL 15+ and enable pgvector extension: `CREATE EXTENSION vector;`
5. Install Redis 7.x and configure connection
6. Set up environment variables: DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, JWT_SECRET, WS_URL
7. Install additional dependencies: `npm install pg@^8.11.0 @node-redis/client@^1.0.0 bullmq@^5.49.1 openai@^5.10.1 jsonwebtoken bcrypt zod`
8. Create folder structure: /app/routes, /app/components, /app/services, /app/models, /app/workers, /app/utils
9. Configure Vite for development with proper aliases and environment variable handling

# Test Strategy:
Verify all dependencies are installed correctly, PostgreSQL has pgvector extension enabled, Redis is running, environment variables are loaded, and the development server starts without errors. Create a simple health check endpoint to test database and Redis connections.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Remix Application with Vite Template [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create new Remix project using the official Vite template and verify basic structure is created
### Details:
Run `npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/vite-express` to initialize the project. Verify the basic Remix structure with app/, public/, and configuration files are created. Test that the development server can start successfully.

## 2. Install Core Dependencies and Remix Packages [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install all required Remix and React dependencies with specific versions
### Details:
Install core packages: `npm install react@18.2.0 @remix-run/node@^2.16.8 @remix-run/react@^2.16.8 @remix-run/serve@^2.16.8`. Also install development dependencies and additional packages needed for the application. Verify all packages install without conflicts.

## 3. Configure PostgreSQL Database with pgvector Extension [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up PostgreSQL 15+ database instance and enable the pgvector extension for vector operations
### Details:
Install PostgreSQL 15+ locally or configure connection to hosted instance. Connect to database and run `CREATE EXTENSION vector;` to enable pgvector support. Create initial database and verify vector extension is properly installed and functional.

## 4. Install and Configure Redis Server [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Redis 7.x instance for caching and session management
### Details:
Install Redis 7.x locally or configure connection to hosted Redis instance. Start Redis server and verify it's running on default port 6379. Test basic Redis operations (SET/GET) to ensure proper functionality. Configure Redis for persistence if needed.

## 5. Configure Environment Variables and Secrets [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up all required environment variables for database, Redis, and API connections
### Details:
Create .env file with DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, SESSION_SECRET, and other required environment variables. Set up .env.example template. Configure different environments (development, test, production) and ensure proper secret management practices.

## 6. Configure TypeScript with Strict Mode [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up TypeScript 5.1.6 configuration with strict mode and project-specific settings
### Details:
Update tsconfig.json to use TypeScript 5.1.6 with strict mode enabled. Configure path mapping, target ES2022, and proper module resolution. Set up type checking scripts and ensure all Remix-specific TypeScript configurations are properly applied. Install @types packages as needed.

## 7. Create Base Folder Structure and Organize Code [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the project folder structure with proper separation of concerns
### Details:
Create organized folder structure: app/components/, app/routes/, app/lib/, app/services/, app/types/, app/utils/, etc. Set up proper imports and exports. Create index files for clean imports. Establish coding conventions and folder naming standards.

## 8. Implement Health Check Endpoint and System Verification [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create health check endpoint to verify all systems are working and implement comprehensive system verification
### Details:
Create /health endpoint that checks database connectivity, Redis connection, environment variables loading, and overall system health. Implement comprehensive verification tests for all configured services. Add logging and monitoring setup. Verify development server starts without errors and all integrations work properly.
