Extend cell state to support column formulas:\n```typescript\ninterface ColumnFormula {\n  columnId: string;\n  formula: string;\n  autoApplyToNewRows: boolean;\n  lastEvaluated: Date;\n  affectedRows: Set<number>;\n}\n\nclass FormulaEngine {\n  private columnFormulas: Map<string, ColumnFormula> = new Map();\n  \n  applyColumnFormula(column: string, formula: string) {\n    // Parse formula and apply to all existing rows\n    const parsed = this.hyperformula.parse(formula);\n    // Store as column-level formula\n    this.columnFormulas.set(column, {\n      columnId: column,\n      formula,\n      autoApplyToNewRows: true,\n      lastEvaluated: new Date(),\n      affectedRows: new Set()\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Add undo/redo hooks to formula evaluation:\n```typescript\ninterface FormulaChange {\n  type: 'cell' | 'column' | 'named_range';\n  previous: string | null;\n  current: string;\n  affectedCells: CellReference[];\n  timestamp: Date;\n}\n\nclass UndoRedoStack {\n  private undoStack: FormulaChange[] = [];\n  private redoStack: FormulaChange[] = [];\n  \n  pushChange(change: FormulaChange) {\n    this.undoStack.push(change);\n    this.redoStack = []; // Clear redo on new change\n  }\n  \n  undo(): FormulaChange | null {\n    const change = this.undoStack.pop();\n    if (change) {\n      this.redoStack.push(change);\n      return this.reverseChange(change);\n    }\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Implement named range registry:\n```typescript\ninterface NamedRange {\n  name: string;\n  range: string; // e.g., 'A1:B10' or 'Sheet1!A:A'\n  description?: string;\n  createdBy: string;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  usedInFormulas: Set<string>;\n}\n\nclass NamedRangeManager {\n  private ranges: Map<string, NamedRange> = new Map();\n  \n  defineRange(name: string, range: string) {\n    // Validate name (no spaces, valid identifier)\n    if (!/^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$/.test(name)) {\n      throw new Error('Invalid range name');\n    }\n    \n    this.ranges.set(name, {\n      name,\n      range,\n      createdAt: new Date(),\n      usedInFormulas: new Set()\n    });\n    \n    // Update HyperFormula instance\n    this.hyperformula.addNamedExpression(name, range);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Create formula versioning system:\n```typescript\ninterface FormulaVersion {\n  id: string;\n  cellRef: string;\n  formula: string;\n  version: number;\n  timestamp: Date;\n  userId: string;\n  changeReason?: string;\n}\n\nclass FormulaHistory {\n  private history: Map<string, FormulaVersion[]> = new Map();\n  \n  recordChange(cellRef: string, formula: string, userId: string) {\n    const versions = this.history.get(cellRef) || [];\n    const newVersion: FormulaVersion = {\n      id: generateId(),\n      cellRef,\n      formula,\n      version: versions.length + 1,\n      timestamp: new Date(),\n      userId\n    };\n    versions.push(newVersion);\n    this.history.set(cellRef, versions);\n  }\n  \n  getHistory(cellRef: string): FormulaVersion[] {\n    return this.history.get(cellRef) || [];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUser features implementation:\n1. Right-click menu to 'Apply formula to column':\n```typescript\nconst ColumnFormulaMenu = ({ column, onApply }) => {\n  const [formula, setFormula] = useState('');\n  \n  return (\n    <ContextMenu>\n      <MenuItem onClick={() => setShowFormulaDialog(true)}>\n        Apply Formula to Column\n      </MenuItem>\n      <Dialog open={showFormulaDialog}>\n        <FormulaEditor \n          value={formula}\n          onChange={setFormula}\n          columnContext={column}\n        />\n        <Button onClick={() => onApply(column, formula)}>\n          Apply to All Rows\n        </Button>\n      </Dialog>\n    </ContextMenu>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n2. Named range manager UI:\n```typescript\nconst NamedRangeManager = () => {\n  const [ranges, setRanges] = useState<NamedRange[]>([]);\n  \n  return (\n    <Panel title=\"Named Ranges\">\n      <Button onClick={openAddDialog}>Add Named Range</Button>\n      <List>\n        {ranges.map(range => (\n          <ListItem key={range.name}>\n            <span>{range.name}</span>\n            <span>{range.range}</span>\n            <Button onClick={() => editRange(range)}>Edit</Button>\n            <Button onClick={() => deleteRange(range)}>Delete</Button>\n          </ListItem>\n        ))}\n      </List>\n    </Panel>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n3. Formula history sidebar:\n```typescript\nconst FormulaHistorySidebar = ({ cellRef }) => {\n  const history = useFormulaHistory(cellRef);\n  \n  return (\n    <Sidebar title=\"Formula History\">\n      {history.map(version => (\n        <HistoryItem key={version.id}>\n          <div>Version {version.version}</div>\n          <div>{version.formula}</div>\n          <div>{formatDate(version.timestamp)}</div>\n          <Button onClick={() => revertToVersion(version)}>\n            Revert\n          </Button>\n        </HistoryItem>\n      ))}\n    </Sidebar>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n4. Keyboard shortcuts for undo/redo:\n```typescript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {\n    if ((e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey) && e.key === 'z' && !e.shiftKey) {\n      e.preventDefault();\n      undoFormulaChange();\n    } else if ((e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey) && (e.key === 'y' || (e.key === 'z' && e.shiftKey))) {\n      e.preventDefault();\n      redoFormulaChange();\n    }\n  };\n  \n  document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);\n  return () => document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);\n}, []);\n```",
