        "title": "Migrate to Asynchronous Embedding Generation with BullMQ",
        "description": "Decouple embedding generation from user requests by converting all synchronous OpenAI calls to queue-based processing using the existing BullMQ infrastructure, improving performance and database connection management while maintaining backward compatibility.",
        "details": "1. Create dedicated embedding queue and processor in BullMQ:\n```typescript\n// app/queues/embedding.queue.server.ts\nimport { Queue, Worker } from 'bullmq';\nimport { redis } from '~/utils/redis.server';\n\nexport const embeddingQueue = new Queue('embeddings', {\n  connection: redis,\n  defaultJobOptions: {\n    removeOnComplete: { count: 100 },\n    removeOnFail: { count: 500 },\n    attempts: 3,\n    backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 2000 }\n  }\n});\n\ninterface EmbeddingJobData {\n  type: 'document' | 'block' | 'page';\n  entityId: string;\n  content: string;\n  metadata?: Record<string, any>;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  priority?: number;\n}\n```\n\n2. Modify ultra-light-indexing.service.ts to queue jobs instead of direct processing:\n```typescript\n// Before (synchronous)\nawait generateEmbedding(content);\n\n// After (asynchronous)\nawait embeddingQueue.add('generate-embedding', {\n  type: 'block',\n  entityId: blockId,\n  content: processedContent,\n  workspaceId,\n  metadata: { pageId, blockType }\n}, {\n  priority: isUserTriggered ? 10 : 1,\n  delay: isUserTriggered ? 0 : 5000 // Delay non-critical updates\n});\n```\n\n3. Create embedding worker with connection pooling:\n```typescript\n// app/workers/embedding.worker.ts\nconst embeddingWorker = new Worker('embeddings', async (job) => {\n  const { type, entityId, content, metadata, workspaceId } = job.data;\n  \n  // Use connection from pool\n  const embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({\n    model: 'text-embedding-3-small',\n    input: content,\n    dimensions: 1536\n  });\n  \n  // Store with optimized transaction\n  await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {\n    await tx.document.upsert({\n      where: { id: entityId },\n      create: {\n        id: entityId,\n        workspaceId,\n        content,\n        embedding: embedding.data[0].embedding,\n        metadata,\n        indexedAt: new Date()\n      },\n      update: {\n        content,\n        embedding: embedding.data[0].embedding,\n        metadata,\n        indexedAt: new Date()\n      }\n    });\n  }, {\n    maxWait: 5000,\n    timeout: 10000\n  });\n  \n  // Release connection immediately\n  return { entityId, status: 'indexed' };\n}, {\n  connection: redis,\n  concurrency: 5, // Process 5 embeddings in parallel\n  limiter: {\n    max: 100,\n    duration: 60000 // Max 100 embeddings per minute (OpenAI limit)\n  }\n});\n```\n\n4. Update editor.$pageId.tsx to use queue instead of synchronous calls:\n```typescript\n// Remove direct embedding generation\n// const embedding = await generateEmbedding(blockContent);\n\n// Add queue-based processing with status tracking\nconst jobId = await embeddingQueue.add('generate-embedding', {\n  type: 'block',\n  entityId: block.id,\n  content: block.content,\n  workspaceId: workspace.id,\n  metadata: { pageId, userId: user.id }\n});\n\n// Optional: Track job status for UI feedback\nconst job = await embeddingQueue.getJob(jobId);\njob.on('completed', (result) => {\n  // Update UI to show indexing complete\n});\n```\n\n5. Implement backward compatibility layer:\n```typescript\n// app/services/embedding-compat.server.ts\nexport async function generateEmbeddingCompat(\n  content: string,\n  options?: { immediate?: boolean }\n) {\n  if (options?.immediate) {\n    // Fallback to synchronous for critical paths\n    return await generateEmbeddingDirect(content);\n  }\n  \n  // Default to queue-based\n  const job = await embeddingQueue.add('generate-embedding', {\n    type: 'direct',\n    content,\n    entityId: crypto.randomUUID()\n  });\n  \n  return job.id; // Return job ID for tracking\n}\n```\n\n6. Add job status monitoring and retry logic:\n```typescript\n// app/services/embedding-monitor.server.ts\nexport class EmbeddingMonitor {\n  async getQueueHealth() {\n    const waiting = await embeddingQueue.getWaitingCount();\n    const active = await embeddingQueue.getActiveCount();\n    const failed = await embeddingQueue.getFailedCount();\n    \n    return { waiting, active, failed, healthy: failed < 100 };\n  }\n  \n  async retryFailedJobs() {\n    const failed = await embeddingQueue.getFailed();\n    for (const job of failed) {\n      await job.retry();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n7. Integrate with existing page-indexing infrastructure:\n```typescript\n// Modify existing page-indexing queue to delegate embedding generation\nawait pageIndexingQueue.add('index-page', {\n  pageId,\n  includeEmbeddings: false // Don't generate inline\n});\n\n// Page indexing worker delegates to embedding queue\nif (shouldGenerateEmbeddings) {\n  await embeddingQueue.addBulk(\n    chunks.map(chunk => ({\n      name: 'generate-embedding',\n      data: {\n        type: 'page-chunk',\n        entityId: chunk.id,\n        content: chunk.content,\n        workspaceId,\n        metadata: { pageId, chunkIndex: chunk.index }\n      }\n    }))\n  );\n}\n```\n\n8. Add database connection pool optimization:\n```typescript\n// app/utils/prisma-pool.server.ts\nimport { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\n\nconst globalForPrisma = global as { prismaPool?: PrismaClient };\n\nexport const prismaPool = globalForPrisma.prismaPool || new PrismaClient({\n  datasources: {\n    db: {\n      url: process.env.DATABASE_URL\n    }\n  },\n  log: ['error', 'warn'],\n  // Optimize for queue workers\n  connectionLimit: 10,\n  pool: {\n    min: 2,\n    max: 10,\n    idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,\n    createTimeoutMillis: 30000,\n    acquireTimeoutMillis: 30000\n  }\n});\n```",
        "testStrategy": "1. Verify queue creation by checking Redis for 'bull:embeddings:*' keys and confirming queue appears in BullMQ dashboard if available.\n\n2. Test async conversion by creating a new block in editor.$pageId.tsx and verifying: a) The request returns immediately (< 100ms), b) No OpenAI API calls are made synchronously, c) A job appears in the embedding queue within 1 second.\n\n3.

Test backward compatibility by calling legacy generateEmbedding functions and confirming they still work through the compatibility layer.\n\n5. Verify worker processing by monitoring: a) Jobs complete successfully (check job.finishedOn timestamps), b) Embeddings are stored in database with correct dimensions (1536), c) Retry logic works for failed jobs (simulate OpenAI API errors).\n\n6. Test priority handling by creating user-triggered and background jobs simultaneously, verify user-triggered jobs process first.\n\n7. Monitor memory usage during bulk operations (create 10,000 blocks rapidly) and verify: a) Memory stays under 512MB, b) No memory leaks in worker process, c) Redis memory usage is reasonable.\n\n8. Test error scenarios: a) OpenAI API timeout - verify job retries with exponential backoff, b) Database connection failure - verify jobs remain in queue and retry, c) Redis disconnection - verify graceful degradation.\n\n9. Verify integration with page-indexing by triggering full page reindex and confirming embedding jobs are created for each chunk.\n\n10. Performance benchmarks: a) Measure p95 response time for block creation (target < 100ms), b) Measure embedding generation throughput (target > 50/minute), c) Measure database connection pool efficiency (target < 10 active connections under load).",

Implement token counting using tiktoken library. Reserve tokens for system prompt, user query, and response. Account for PDF text content in token calculations.\n\n2. **Hybrid Loading Strategy**: \n   - **Direct Inclusion** (Context Stuffing): Include full schema for all referenced files. Add sample rows for small files (<1000 rows). Include statistical summaries for numerical columns. For PDFs, include relevant page text.\n   - **Vector Search** (For excess data): Generate embeddings for file chunks using OpenAI. Store in pgvector alongside table metadata. Retrieve relevant chunks based on user query. Include retrieved context separately in prompt.\n\n3. **Intelligent Sampling**: When files exceed token budget, implement smart sampling:\n   - Take first N rows for time-series context\n   - Random sampling for statistical representation  \n   - Include rows with extreme values (min/max)\n   - Stratified sampling for categorical columns\n   - Query-relevant sampling based on detected filters\n   - For PDFs, prioritize pages mentioned in query\n\n4. **Priority System**: User-referenced files get highest priority. Recently queried files get medium priority. Background files get minimal context. Allow manual priority override in file management UI. PDFs with specific page references get targeted inclusion.\n\n5. **Context Optimization**: Compress schemas by removing redundant information. Use abbreviated column descriptions. Cache preprocessed context for repeated queries. Dynamically adjust based on query complexity. Optimize PDF text extraction to relevant sections.\n\n6. **Metadata Tracking**: Store what data was included vs excluded in each query. Track token usage per query for optimization. Log retrieval performance metrics.

Schema context format implemented supports table name, enhanced column descriptions with constraints, row counts, statistical summaries, and sample data rows for comprehensive natural language to SQL conversion.\n</info added on 2025-10-06T23:37:00.744Z>",
