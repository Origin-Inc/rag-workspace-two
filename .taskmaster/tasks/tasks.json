        "description": "Build critical production-ready infrastructure including queue processing system for indexing_queue, rate limiting, differential updates, optimistic locking, database optimizations, and performance monitoring to support medium to large scale deployments.",
        "details": "1. **Queue Processing System (CRITICAL - HIGH PRIORITY)**\n   - Implement BullMQ worker to process indexing_queue table entries:\n   ```typescript\n   // app/services/queue/indexing-processor.ts\n   import { Worker, Queue } from 'bullmq';\n   import { redis } from '~/services/redis.server';\n   \n   const indexingQueue = new Queue('indexing', { connection: redis });\n   \n   const worker = new Worker('indexing', async (job) => {\n     const { pageId, blockIds, action } = job.data;\n     try {\n       // Process embeddings for changed blocks\n       const blocks = await prisma.block.findMany({ where: { id: { in: blockIds } } });\n       const embeddings = await generateEmbeddings(blocks);\n       await storeEmbeddings(embeddings);\n       \n       // Mark queue entry as processed\n       await prisma.indexingQueue.update({\n         where: { id: job.data.queueId },\n         data: { status: 'completed', processedAt: new Date() }\n       });\n     } catch (error) {\n       // Move to dead letter queue after 3 retries\n       if (job.attemptsMade >= 3) {\n         await deadLetterQueue.add('failed-indexing', job.data);\n       }\n       throw error;\n     }\n   }, { connection: redis, concurrency: 5 });\n   ```\n   - Implement dead letter queue for failed items with alerting\n   - Add queue depth monitoring and auto-scaling triggers\n   - Create cleanup job to remove processed entries older than 7 days\n\n2. **Rate Limiting (HIGH PRIORITY)**\n   - Implement middleware using Redis for per-user rate limiting:\n   ```typescript\n   // app/middleware/rate-limit.ts\n   import { RateLimiterRedis } from 'rate-limiter-flexible';\n   \n   const rateLimiter = new RateLimiterRedis({\n     storeClient: redis,\n     keyPrefix: 'rl:page-save',\n     points: 30, // 30 saves\n     duration: 60, // per minute\n     blockDuration: 60, // block for 1 minute if exceeded\n   });\n   \n   export async function rateLimitMiddleware(request: Request, userId: string) {\n     try {\n       await rateLimiter.consume(userId);\n     } catch (rejRes) {\n       throw new Response('Rate limit exceeded', { \n         status: 429,\n         headers: { 'Retry-After': String(Math.round(rejRes.msBeforeNext / 1000)) }\n       });\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   -

Add version field to Pages table:\n   ```sql\n   ALTER TABLE pages ADD COLUMN version INTEGER DEFAULT 1;\n   \n   -- Create optimistic lock check in update trigger\n   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_page_version()\n   RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$\n   BEGIN\n     IF OLD.version != NEW.version - 1 THEN\n       RAISE EXCEPTION 'Concurrent modification detected';\n     END IF;\n     RETURN NEW;\n   END;\n   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n   ```\n   - Implement version checking in save operations:\n   ```typescript\n   async function savePage(pageId: string, data: any, currentVersion: number) {\n     const result = await prisma.page.update({\n       where: { id: pageId, version: currentVersion },\n       data: { ...data, version: { increment: 1 } }\n     });\n     if (!result) throw new ConflictError('Page was modified by another user');\n     return result;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Differential Updates (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**\n   - Implement JSON Patch (RFC 6902) for block updates:\n   ```typescript\n   // app/services/diff/block-differ.ts\n   import { compare } from 'fast-json-patch';\n   \n   export function calculateBlockDiff(oldBlocks: Block[], newBlocks: Block[]) {\n     const patches = compare(oldBlocks, newBlocks);\n     return patches.filter(patch => \n       patch.op === 'add' || patch.op === 'replace' || patch.op === 'remove'\n     );\n   }\n   \n   // Send only patches over network\n   async function saveBlockChanges(pageId: string, patches: Operation[]) {\n     await fetch('/api/pages/patch', {\n       method: 'PATCH',\n       body: JSON.stringify({ pageId, patches }),\n       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json-patch+json' }\n     });\n   }\n   ```\n   - Store full snapshots every 10 changes for recovery\n   - Implement patch validation and conflict resolution\n\n5. **Database Optimizations**\n   - Add strategic indexes:\n   ```sql\n   -- Partial index for recent updates (90% queries are for last 7 days)\n   CREATE INDEX pages_updated_recent_idx ON pages(updated_at DESC)\n   WHERE updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';\n   \n   -- GIN index for JSONB blocks searching\n   CREATE INDEX blocks_data_gin_idx ON blocks USING gin(data);\n   \n   -- Composite index for workspace queries\n   CREATE INDEX pages_workspace_updated_idx ON pages(workspace_id, updated_at DESC);\n   ```\n   - Configure Prisma connection pooling:\n   ```typescript\n   // app/services/db.server.ts\n   const prisma = new PrismaClient({\n     datasources: {\n       db: {\n         url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,\n       },\n     },\n     log: ['error', 'warn'],\n     // Connection pool settings\n     connectionLimit: 20,\n     pool: {\n       min: 5,\n       max: 20,\n       idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,\n       createTimeoutMillis: 30000,\n       acquireTimeoutMillis: 30000,\n     },\n   });\n   ```\n   - Implement TTL-based cleanup for indexing_queue\n\n6. **Performance Monitoring (LOW PRIORITY)**\n   - Add Prometheus metrics:\n   ```typescript\n   // app/services/metrics.server.ts\n   import { Histogram, Counter, Gauge, register } from 'prom-client';\n   \n   export const metrics = {\n     saveDuration: new Histogram({\n       name: 'page_save_duration_seconds',\n       help: 'Duration of page save operations',\n       labelNames: ['workspace_id', 'status'],\n       buckets: [0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5]\n     }),\n     saveErrors: new Counter({\n       name: 'page_save_errors_total',\n       help: 'Total number of page save errors',\n       labelNames: ['workspace_id', 'error_type']\n     }),\n     queueDepth: new Gauge({\n       name: 'indexing_queue_depth',\n       help: 'Current depth of indexing queue'\n     }),\n     blockCount: new Gauge({\n       name: 'blocks_per_page',\n       help: 'Number of blocks per page',\n       labelNames: ['workspace_id']\n     })\n   };\n   ```\n   -

        "details": "1. Create dedicated embedding queue and processor in BullMQ:\n```typescript\n// app/queues/embedding.queue.server.ts\nimport { Queue, Worker } from 'bullmq';\nimport { redis } from '~/utils/redis.server';\n\nexport const embeddingQueue = new Queue('embeddings', {\n  connection: redis,\n  defaultJobOptions: {\n    removeOnComplete: { count: 100 },\n    removeOnFail: { count: 500 },\n    attempts: 3,\n    backoff: { type: 'exponential', delay: 2000 }\n  }\n});\n\ninterface EmbeddingJobData {\n  type: 'document' | 'block' | 'page';\n  entityId: string;\n  content: string;\n  metadata?: Record<string, any>;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  priority?: number;\n}\n```\n\n2. Modify ultra-light-indexing.service.ts to queue jobs instead of direct processing:\n```typescript\n// Before (synchronous)\nawait generateEmbedding(content);\n\n// After (asynchronous)\nawait embeddingQueue.add('generate-embedding', {\n  type: 'block',\n  entityId: blockId,\n  content: processedContent,\n  workspaceId,\n  metadata: { pageId, blockType }\n}, {\n  priority: isUserTriggered ? 10 : 1,\n  delay: isUserTriggered ? 0 : 5000 // Delay non-critical updates\n});\n```\n\n3. Create embedding worker with connection pooling:\n```typescript\n// app/workers/embedding.worker.ts\nconst embeddingWorker = new Worker('embeddings', async (job) => {\n  const { type, entityId, content, metadata, workspaceId } = job.data;\n  \n  // Use connection from pool\n  const embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({\n    model: 'text-embedding-3-small',\n    input: content,\n    dimensions: 1536\n  });\n  \n  // Store with optimized transaction\n  await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {\n    await tx.document.upsert({\n      where: { id: entityId },\n      create: {\n        id: entityId,\n        workspaceId,\n        content,\n        embedding: embedding.data[0].embedding,\n        metadata,\n        indexedAt: new Date()\n      },\n      update: {\n        content,\n        embedding: embedding.data[0].embedding,\n        metadata,\n        indexedAt: new Date()\n      }\n    });\n  }, {\n    maxWait: 5000,\n    timeout: 10000\n  });\n  \n  // Release connection immediately\n  return { entityId, status: 'indexed' };\n}, {\n  connection: redis,\n  concurrency: 5, // Process 5 embeddings in parallel\n  limiter: {\n    max: 100,\n    duration: 60000 // Max 100 embeddings per minute (OpenAI limit)\n  }\n});\n```\n\n4. Update editor.$pageId.tsx to use queue instead of synchronous calls:\n```typescript\n// Remove direct embedding generation\n// const embedding = await generateEmbedding(blockContent);\n\n// Add queue-based processing with status tracking\nconst jobId = await embeddingQueue.add('generate-embedding', {\n  type: 'block',\n  entityId: block.id,\n  content: block.content,\n  workspaceId: workspace.id,\n  metadata: { pageId, userId: user.id }\n});\n\n// Optional: Track job status for UI feedback\nconst job = await embeddingQueue.getJob(jobId);\njob.on('completed', (result) => {\n  // Update UI to show indexing complete\n});\n```\n\n5. Implement backward compatibility layer:\n```typescript\n// app/services/embedding-compat.server.ts\nexport async function generateEmbeddingCompat(\n  content: string,\n  options?: { immediate?: boolean }\n) {\n  if (options?.immediate) {\n    // Fallback to synchronous for critical paths\n    return await generateEmbeddingDirect(content);\n  }\n  \n  // Default to queue-based\n  const job = await embeddingQueue.add('generate-embedding', {\n    type: 'direct',\n    content,\n    entityId: crypto.randomUUID()\n  });\n  \n  return job.id; // Return job ID for tracking\n}\n```\n\n6. Add job status monitoring and retry logic:\n```typescript\n// app/services/embedding-monitor.server.ts\nexport class EmbeddingMonitor {\n  async getQueueHealth() {\n    const waiting = await embeddingQueue.getWaitingCount();\n    const active = await embeddingQueue.getActiveCount();\n    const failed = await embeddingQueue.getFailedCount();\n    \n    return { waiting, active, failed, healthy: failed < 100 };\n  }\n  \n  async retryFailedJobs() {\n    const failed = await embeddingQueue.getFailed();\n    for (const job of failed) {\n      await job.retry();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n7. Integrate with existing page-indexing infrastructure:\n```typescript\n// Modify existing page-indexing queue to delegate embedding generation\nawait pageIndexingQueue.add('index-page', {\n  pageId,\n  includeEmbeddings: false // Don't generate inline\n});\n\n// Page indexing worker delegates to embedding queue\nif (shouldGenerateEmbeddings) {\n  await embeddingQueue.addBulk(\n    chunks.map(chunk => ({\n      name: 'generate-embedding',\n      data: {\n        type: 'page-chunk',\n        entityId: chunk.id,\n        content: chunk.content,\n        workspaceId,\n        metadata: { pageId, chunkIndex: chunk.index }\n      }\n    }))\n  );\n}\n```\n\n8. Add database connection pool optimization:\n```typescript\n// app/utils/prisma-pool.server.ts\nimport { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\n\nconst globalForPrisma = global as { prismaPool?: PrismaClient };\n\nexport const prismaPool = globalForPrisma.prismaPool || new PrismaClient({\n  datasources: {\n    db: {\n      url: process.env.DATABASE_URL\n    }\n  },\n  log: ['error', 'warn'],\n  // Optimize for queue workers\n  connectionLimit: 10,\n  pool: {\n    min: 2,\n    max: 10,\n    idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,\n    createTimeoutMillis: 30000,\n    acquireTimeoutMillis: 30000\n  }\n});\n```",

Verify integration with page-indexing by triggering full page reindex and confirming embedding jobs are created for each chunk.\n\n10.
