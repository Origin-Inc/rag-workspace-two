# Title: MVP Pivot - Build AI Block with Inline Chat
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the AI Block that appears when users press Space anywhere. This is the magic moment - type a question, get grounded answers from your workspace data, insert charts/tables/content directly into the page.
# Details:
1. Press Space in any block to activate AI. 2. Inline chat UI appears with context awareness. 3. AI knows what's on the page, what database you're looking at, what project you're in. 4. Responses are grounded in YOUR data via RAG. 5. One-click insert of AI-generated content as new blocks. 6. This is the core wow - AI that actually knows your content.

# Test Strategy:
Test Space hotkey activation from any block type. Verify context awareness captures current page content, visible database schemas, and project scope. Test RAG integration returns relevant workspace data. Verify AI responses can generate and insert various block types (text, tables, charts). Test performance with instant UI response on Space press. Validate that AI context includes page hierarchy and block relationships.
