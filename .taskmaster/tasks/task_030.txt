# Task ID: 30
# Title: MVP Pivot - Production Deployment Preparation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 29
# Priority: high
# Description: Polish for Launch - Make It Magical. Final polish that makes users say wow. Delightful interactions, helpful onboarding, showcase the magic of AI + data in the first 30 seconds.
# Details:
1. Amazing first-time experience - sample data that shows off capabilities, pre-populated with compelling examples that demonstrate AI-powered analytics immediately.
2. Interactive tutorial - 'Try pressing Space to ask AI about this data' with guided tooltips and progressive disclosure of features.
3. Delightful micro-interactions - subtle animations on data updates, smooth transitions between views, optional sound effects for key actions, haptic feedback on mobile.
4. Smart defaults - detect CSV on clipboard and offer instant import, suggest relevant questions based on data schema, auto-configure visualizations based on data types.
5. Shareable demos - let users share their AI-generated insights with public links, embed widgets, or export as interactive reports.
6. The final wow - it just works beautifully with zero configuration, instant responses, and intelligent assistance throughout.
7. Security hardening - implement input sanitization, rate limiting (100 req/min), XSS/CSRF protection.
8. Production monitoring - set up error tracking (Sentry), performance monitoring, uptime checks for 99.9% availability.
9. Rollback procedures - automated rollback on critical errors, feature flags for gradual rollout.

# Test Strategy:
Test first-time user experience with fresh accounts and sample data loading. Verify interactive tutorial completion rates and user engagement metrics. Test micro-interactions perform at 60fps across devices. Validate smart defaults correctly detect and suggest based on various data types. Test sharing features generate working public links with proper access controls. Load test to ensure <200ms response times for AI queries. Security audit for input sanitization and rate limiting. Test monitoring alerts trigger correctly. Verify rollback procedures work within 5 minutes.
