# Task ID: 26
# Title: MVP Pivot - Implement Chart and Table Output Blocks
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Build beautiful AI output blocks that transform AI responses into stunning charts and tables users can insert directly into their pages. Using Recharts for visually impressive, presentation-ready visualizations that make data come alive with interactive, professional-quality output.
# Details:
1. Auto-detect when to show charts vs tables based on data structure and content type
2. Chart types:
   - Bar charts for comparisons and rankings
   - Line charts for trends and time series
   - Pie charts for percentages and proportions
   - Funnel charts for conversion and process flows
3. Beautiful, interactive visualizations:
   - Smooth animations on load and interaction
   - Hover tooltips with detailed information
   - Click interactions for drilling down
   - Responsive design that looks great at any size
4. Tables with advanced features:
   - Sortable columns with visual indicators
   - Conditional formatting for highlighting key data
   - Pagination for large datasets
   - Export capabilities (CSV, JSON)
5. One-click insert functionality:
   - AI outputs automatically formatted as blocks
   - Direct insertion into page editor
   - Blocks are fully editable after insertion
   - Maintain data source references
6. Visual polish and wow factor:
   - Modern, clean design with subtle gradients
   - Consistent color schemes across chart types
   - Professional typography and spacing
   - Dark mode support
7. Provenance indicators:
   - Small badges showing AI-generated status
   - Expandable source information
   - Confidence scores where applicable

# Test Strategy:
1. Test auto-detection logic with various data structures (arrays of objects, time series, categorical data) and verify correct chart type selection
2. Test each chart type (bar, line, pie, funnel) with real AI response data and verify correct rendering, animations, and interactions
3. Test table functionality including sorting, filtering, pagination with datasets of 10, 100, 1000+ rows
4. Test one-click insertion into page editor, ensuring blocks maintain data and are fully editable
5. Test visual consistency across light/dark themes and different viewport sizes
6. Test performance with large datasets (10,000+ data points) ensuring smooth interactions
7. Test provenance indicators display correctly and source information is accessible
8. Test accessibility features including keyboard navigation and screen reader support

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design AI Output Detection System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a robust system to analyze AI responses and automatically detect when chart or table visualization would be most appropriate based on data structure and content patterns
### Details:
Implement a detector service that analyzes AI response content using pattern matching and data structure analysis. Detect arrays of objects, time series data, categorical comparisons, percentages/proportions, and key-value pairs. Create confidence scoring for chart type selection (bar, line, pie, funnel) vs table display. Handle edge cases like mixed data types and nested structures.

## 2. Create Chart Output Block Component [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Build the main ChartOutputBlock React component that renders beautiful, interactive Recharts visualizations with smooth animations and professional styling
### Details:
Create ChartOutputBlock.tsx component that accepts AI response data and chart type. Implement support for BarChart, LineChart, PieChart, and FunnelChart from Recharts. Add responsive container wrapper for automatic resizing. Include default color schemes with gradient support. Implement hover tooltips, click interactions, and smooth load animations. Add dark mode support with theme-aware colors.

## 3. Create Table Output Block Component [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Build a sophisticated TableOutputBlock component with advanced features like sorting, conditional formatting, and pagination
### Details:
Create TableOutputBlock.tsx with virtual scrolling for performance. Implement sortable columns with visual indicators (arrows). Add conditional formatting engine for highlighting cells based on values (e.g., negative numbers in red, highest values in green). Implement client-side pagination with configurable page sizes. Add column width auto-adjustment and text truncation with tooltips.

## 4. Implement Export Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 26.2, 26.3
### Description: Add export capabilities for both charts and tables supporting CSV, JSON, and image formats
### Details:
For tables: implement CSV export using papaparse, JSON export with proper formatting. For charts: implement PNG/SVG export using canvas/svg conversion. Add download buttons with appropriate icons. Include filename generation with timestamp. Handle large dataset exports with progress indicators. Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for quick sharing.

## 5. Build Insert-to-Page Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 26.2, 26.3
### Description: Create seamless one-click insertion functionality to add AI-generated charts and tables directly into the page editor
### Details:
Add 'Insert to Page' button on each output block. Implement block conversion from AI output to editor block format. Maintain data references and provenance information. Handle insertion at cursor position or end of page. Preserve all formatting and interactivity after insertion. Add undo/redo support for insertions.

## 6. Add Provenance and Confidence Indicators [done]
### Dependencies: 26.2, 26.3
### Description: Implement visual indicators showing AI-generated status, confidence scores, and expandable source information
### Details:
Create ProvenanceBadge component with AI sparkle icon. Add confidence score display (when available) with color coding. Implement expandable panel showing source query, model used, timestamp, and raw data. Add subtle visual distinction for AI-generated vs user-created content. Include 'Regenerate' button to refresh with updated data.

## 7. Implement Auto-Layout and Responsive Design [done]
### Dependencies: 26.2, 26.3
### Description: Create intelligent auto-layout system that ensures charts and tables look professional at any size with responsive breakpoints
