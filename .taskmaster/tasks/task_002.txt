# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Authentication and Authorization System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Build JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC) for workspaces and pages, including user registration, login, and permission management
# Details:
1. Create database schema for users, roles, and permissions:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE TABLE roles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
  user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
  role_id INT REFERENCES roles(id),
  workspace_id INT REFERENCES workspaces(id)
);
```
2. Implement JWT token generation and validation using jsonwebtoken
3. Create authentication middleware for protected routes
4. Build registration endpoint with bcrypt password hashing
5. Implement login endpoint with JWT token generation
6. Create RBAC middleware to check permissions
7. Add CSRF protection using double-submit cookie pattern
8. Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints using Redis
9. Create session management with refresh tokens

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration with valid/invalid data, test login flow, verify JWT tokens are properly generated and validated, test RBAC permissions for different roles, test rate limiting, verify CSRF protection, test token refresh flow

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Database Schema for Authentication [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement database tables for users, roles, permissions, and workspace associations with proper constraints and indexes
### Details:
Create users table with email, password_hash, created_at fields. Create roles table for permission management. Create user_roles junction table linking users to roles per workspace. Add proper foreign key constraints, unique indexes, and performance indexes for common queries.

## 2. Implement Password Hashing System [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Build secure password hashing using bcrypt with proper salt rounds and validation functions
### Details:
Implement password hashing with bcrypt using 12+ salt rounds. Create password validation functions with strength requirements. Add password comparison utilities for login verification. Include timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks.

## 3. Build JWT Token Management System [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement JWT token generation, validation, and refresh functionality with proper security measures
### Details:
Create JWT token generation with user claims and expiration. Implement token validation middleware with signature verification. Build refresh token system with rotation. Add token blacklisting for logout. Use secure signing algorithms (RS256 or HS256 with strong secrets).

## 4. Create Authentication Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Build middleware for request authentication, token validation, and user context injection
### Details:
Create Express/Fastify middleware for JWT validation. Extract user information from valid tokens. Handle authentication errors gracefully. Provide optional authentication for public endpoints. Include request logging for security monitoring.

## 5. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Build comprehensive permission system with roles, permissions, and workspace-level access control
### Details:
Define role hierarchy (owner, admin, member, viewer). Create permission checking functions for resources. Implement workspace-level role assignments. Build permission inheritance system. Create authorization middleware for route protection.

## 6. Add CSRF Protection [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection with token generation and validation
### Details:
Generate CSRF tokens for authenticated sessions. Validate CSRF tokens on state-changing requests. Implement double-submit cookie pattern. Add CSRF token to API responses. Configure proper SameSite cookie attributes.

## 7. Build Rate Limiting System [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
### Details:
Create rate limiting for login attempts (5 attempts per 15 minutes). Implement account lockout after repeated failures. Add rate limiting for registration endpoints. Use Redis or in-memory store for counters. Include IP-based and user-based limiting.

## 8. Implement Session Management [done]
### Dependencies: 2.6
### Description: Build secure session handling with proper cookie configuration and session storage
### Details:
Configure secure session cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite flags. Implement session storage with Redis or database. Add session cleanup for expired sessions. Build session invalidation for logout. Include concurrent session limits per user.

## 9. Create User Registration and Login Flow [done]
### Dependencies: 2.5, 2.7
### Description: Build complete user onboarding with registration, email verification, and secure login process
### Details:
Create user registration endpoint with input validation. Implement email verification system. Build secure login flow with proper error handling. Add password reset functionality. Include account activation/deactivation features.

## 10. Comprehensive Security Testing Suite [done]
### Dependencies: 2.8, 2.9
### Description: Create extensive test suite covering all authentication security scenarios and vulnerability testing
### Details:
Write unit tests for all auth functions. Create integration tests for complete auth flows. Add security tests for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, timing attacks). Test rate limiting and CSRF protection. Include load testing for auth endpoints. Add penetration testing scenarios.
