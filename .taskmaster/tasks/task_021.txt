# Task ID: 21
# Title: Enhance Database Block with AI Analysis
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Add AI analysis capabilities to the existing editable database block. Keep all editing features but add an 'Analyze with AI' button that opens an AI block pre-loaded with the database context. This creates the wow factor of seamless data analysis.
# Details:
1. Keep the existing database block fully editable with all current features (including complex views, formula engine, and virtual scrolling). 2. Add 'Analyze with AI' button to database toolbar. 3. When clicked, create new AI block below with context about the database schema and data. 4. AI can read database content and generate insights, charts, summaries. 5. Both manually created and imported databases work the same way. 6. Maintain full editing capabilities while adding AI-powered analysis as an enhancement.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all existing database block functionality remains intact (editing, sorting, filtering, formula calculations). 2. Test 'Analyze with AI' button appears in toolbar and is clickable. 3. Verify clicking button creates new AI block below with pre-loaded database context. 4. Test AI block receives correct schema and sample data from database. 5. Verify AI can generate insights, charts, and summaries based on database content. 6. Test with both manually created and imported databases. 7. Verify AI analysis works with all view types (Table, Kanban, Calendar, Timeline).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add 'Analyze with AI' button to database toolbar [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate a new 'Analyze with AI' button into the existing DatabaseToolbar component that triggers AI analysis workflow.
### Details:
Add button to DatabaseToolbar.tsx with appropriate icon and tooltip. Button should be visible for all database view types and maintain consistent styling with existing toolbar buttons.

## 2. Create database context extraction service [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build service to extract database schema, column types, sample data, and statistics for AI context generation.
### Details:
Create function that gathers: schema definition, column names and types, first 10-20 rows of data, basic statistics (row count, unique values per column), and any existing filters or sorts applied.

## 3. Implement AI block creation and positioning [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Create logic to instantiate new AI block below database block with proper positioning and focus management.
### Details:
Use existing block creation APIs to add AI block immediately below the database block. Ensure proper spacing and auto-scroll to make new block visible. Set focus to AI input field.

## 4. Build AI context injection system [done]
### Dependencies: 21.2, 21.3
### Description: Develop system to inject database context into AI block's initial prompt and maintain reference to source database.
### Details:
Create structured prompt template that includes database schema, sample data, and metadata. Store reference to source database block ID for ongoing context. Enable AI to query live database data.

## 5. Add AI analysis capabilities [done]
### Dependencies: 21.4
### Description: Implement AI features for data analysis including insights generation, chart creation, and summary reports.
### Details:
Enable AI to: generate statistical insights, create visualizations using existing charting libraries, produce summary reports, identify patterns and anomalies, suggest data transformations or queries.

## 6. Ensure compatibility with imported databases [done]
### Dependencies: 21.2, 21.4
### Description: Test and ensure AI analysis works seamlessly with databases created from CSV imports and other data sources.
### Details:
Verify context extraction works for imported data with various column types. Handle edge cases like missing values, mixed data types, and large datasets. Ensure consistent behavior across all database sources.
