# Task ID: 27
# Title: MVP Pivot - Create Provenance and Citation System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 24, 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Every AI answer shows where it came from. Users can see which documents, databases, or pages the AI used. This builds trust - the AI isn't making things up.
# Details:
1. Every AI response includes source indicators.
2. Click to expand and see exact documents/data used.
3. Highlight confidence levels (high/medium/low).
4. Show when AI is using workspace data vs general knowledge.
5. Simple, non-intrusive citations.
6. Users trust AI because they can verify sources.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test that every AI response displays source indicators inline with the content.
2. Verify click-to-expand functionality reveals detailed source information including document names, sections, and relevance scores.
3. Test confidence level indicators (high/medium/low) display correctly based on retrieval scores.
4. Verify clear differentiation between workspace data sources and general AI knowledge.
5. Test citation UI remains non-intrusive and doesn't interfere with content readability.
6. Verify source verification flow allows users to navigate to original documents.
7. Test performance impact of citation rendering stays under 50ms.
8. Verify citations update correctly when AI responses are regenerated.
