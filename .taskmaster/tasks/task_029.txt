# Task ID: 29
# Title: MVP Pivot - Performance Optimization and Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 27
# Priority: high
# Description: Make It Lightning Fast - Speed is part of the wow factor. AI responses in 2-3 seconds, instant UI reactions, smooth animations. Users should feel the app is magical and responsive.
# Details:
1. AI responses in 2-3 seconds using streaming - implement server-sent events for real-time token streaming, show typing indicators instantly.
2. Instant UI feedback - loading states appear immediately, skeleton screens for data fetching, optimistic updates for all user actions.
3. Database operations feel instant with optimistic updates - update UI immediately while background sync happens, rollback on failure gracefully.
4. Smooth animations and transitions - 60fps animations using CSS transforms, React Spring for complex interactions, reduced motion support.
5. Pre-fetch and cache smartly - prefetch next likely actions, cache API responses in Redis, use SWR for client-side caching.
6. The wow is speed - it feels faster than competitors. Target metrics: AI streaming starts <500ms, UI interactions <50ms, page transitions <200ms.

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure AI response streaming latency - first token should arrive <500ms, complete responses in 2-3s for typical queries.
2. Test UI responsiveness - all clicks/interactions show feedback within 50ms using React DevTools Profiler.
3. Verify optimistic updates work correctly - test network failure scenarios and rollback behavior.
4. Animation performance testing - use Chrome DevTools to ensure 60fps during transitions.
5. Cache effectiveness - monitor cache hit rates >90% for repeated operations.
6. Load test with 100 concurrent users - all performance targets must hold under load.
7. Competitive benchmarking - measure against Notion, Coda, Airtable for common operations.
