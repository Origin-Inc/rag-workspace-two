# Task ID: 25
# Title: MVP Pivot - Build Numeric Analytics Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: high
# Description: When users ask data questions, the AI queries the actual database for real numbers. No hallucinations. Questions like 'total sales this month' get exact answers from your data.
# Details:
1. Parse natural language to SQL queries using AI to understand user intent and map to database schema.
2. Execute against actual database tables with proper error handling and timeout management.
3. Support aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX) for numeric computations.
4. Handle date ranges and filters with intelligent date parsing (today, this month, last year, etc.).
5. Return exact numbers with source indication showing which tables/columns were queried.
6. This builds trust - the AI uses real data, not made-up numbers.
7. Implement query result caching for frequently accessed computations.
8. Support GROUP BY operations for segmented analytics.
9. Include query audit logging for compliance and debugging.

# Test Strategy:
Test natural language parsing converts questions like 'total revenue last quarter' into correct SQL. Verify aggregation functions return exact database values. Test date range parsing handles relative dates correctly. Ensure source attribution shows queried tables/columns. Test caching improves response times for repeated queries. Verify the system never returns hallucinated numbers - only real database values or clear error messages when data is unavailable.
