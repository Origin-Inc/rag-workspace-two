# Task ID: 46
# Title: Create Document Chunking and Embedding Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 45
# Priority: high
# Description: Build pipeline for chunking uploaded documents and generating embeddings for RAG context
# Details:
Extend SemanticChunker for document-specific chunking. Implement smart chunking based on document structure. Generate embeddings using OpenAI API. Store document chunks with metadata. Link chunks to chat instances. Implement background processing with BullMQ.

# Test Strategy:
Test chunking strategies for different formats. Verify embedding generation. Test chunk retrieval accuracy. Check background job processing.
