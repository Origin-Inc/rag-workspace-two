# Task ID: 24
# Title: MVP Pivot - Implement LLM Orchestration Layer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Build Smart AI Response Generation system that makes AI incredibly intelligent about user data. The system should understand natural language questions about databases, documents, and projects, then generate perfect responses with appropriate visualizations (charts, tables, insights) using actual data rather than hallucinations.
# Details:
1. Natural Language Understanding Layer:
   - Process questions like 'summarize my tasks', 'show revenue by month', 'what are my blocked items'
   - Intent classification to determine query type (data query, content search, analytics, summary)
   - Context extraction to identify relevant entities and time ranges

2. Smart Response Determination:
   - Automatically decide response format: text summary, data table, chart visualization, or combination
   - For data questions: Query actual database using Prisma, never hallucinate numbers
   - For content questions: Use RAG retrieval to find relevant documents
   - For analytics: Generate appropriate visualizations (bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends)

3. Structured Output Generation:
   - Use OpenAI Structured Outputs API for 100% JSON schema compliance
   - Generate valid block formats that integrate seamlessly with editor
   - Include metadata for confidence scores and data sources

4. Data Integration:
   - Direct database queries for real-time accurate data
   - RAG integration for document and content retrieval
   - Combine multiple data sources for comprehensive answers

5. User Experience:
   - Response time under 2 seconds for most queries
   - Clear indication of data sources used
   - Fallback strategies for ambiguous queries
   - Make users think 'wow, it actually understands my data!'

# Test Strategy:
1. Test natural language understanding with diverse queries:
   - Data queries: 'show my completed tasks', 'revenue last quarter', 'user growth rate'
   - Content queries: 'find documentation about authentication', 'summarize project requirements'
   - Mixed queries: 'compare this month's performance to our goals in the planning doc'

2. Verify response format selection:
   - Numeric comparisons generate bar charts
   - Time series data generates line charts
   - Lists generate formatted tables
   - Summaries generate structured text blocks

3. Test data accuracy:
   - Compare AI responses against direct database queries
   - Verify no hallucinated numbers
   - Test with empty datasets and edge cases

4. Test structured output compliance:
   - All responses pass JSON schema validation
   - Generated blocks render correctly in editor
   - Test error handling for API failures

5. Performance testing:
   - Response time < 2s for 95% of queries
   - Concurrent query handling
   - Graceful degradation under load

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Natural Language Intent Classification Service [done]
### Dependencies: None

Parse queries to identify entities (users, projects, dates), time ranges (last month, this quarter), and relevant data sources. Use NLP techniques to extract structured context from unstructured queries.

## 3. Implement Dynamic Query Router [done]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2
### Description: Route classified queries to appropriate data sources: Prisma for database queries, RAG for content search, analytics engine for visualizations.
### Details:
Create routing logic that determines whether to query database directly, search indexed content, or generate analytics based on query intent and extracted context.

## 4. Integrate OpenAI Structured Outputs API [done]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Implement OpenAI Structured Outputs API for 100% JSON schema compliance in response generation.
### Details:
Configure OpenAI API calls with JSON schema definitions for different response types. Ensure all AI responses conform to predefined block editor formats with proper validation.

## 5. Build Database Query Execution Engine [done]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Execute real-time database queries using Prisma based on natural language intent, ensuring no hallucinated data.
### Details:
Create secure Prisma query builder that translates natural language intents into database queries. Include proper filtering, aggregation, and join operations for complex data requests.

## 6. Enhance RAG Content Retrieval [done]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Integrate existing RAG system for document and content retrieval based on natural language queries.
### Details:
Extend current RAG implementation to handle orchestrated queries from the LLM layer. Optimize retrieval for specific content types and improve relevance scoring.

## 7. Create Multi-Source Data Aggregation Service [done]
### Dependencies: 24.5, 24.6
### Description: Combine data from multiple sources (database, RAG, analytics) into unified responses.
### Details:
Build aggregation service that merges results from database queries, content search, and analytics into coherent responses. Handle data conflicts and provide source attribution.

## 8. Build Dynamic Visualization Generation [done]
### Dependencies: 24.5
### Description: Generate appropriate chart visualizations based on data patterns and query context (bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends).
### Details:
Implement chart type selection logic based on data characteristics. Integrate with existing visualization components to generate charts dynamically based on query results.

## 9. Implement Response Format Determination [done]
### Dependencies: 24.7, 24.8
### Description: Automatically decide response format: text summary, data table, chart visualization, or combination based on query type and data.
### Details:
Create decision engine that analyzes query intent and data patterns to determine optimal response format. Support mixed responses with multiple visualization types.

## 10. Build Block Editor Integration Layer [done]
### Dependencies: 24.4, 24.9
