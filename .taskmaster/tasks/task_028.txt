# Task ID: 28
# Title: Future: Google Sheets Integration
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: low
# Description: Post-MVP feature to sync with Google Sheets. Not essential for wow factor - users can upload CSV exports from Sheets instead.
# Details:
1. This is a nice-to-have, not core MVP.
2. Users can export from Google Sheets as CSV and upload.
3. Focus on core wow factors first: AI that knows your data, beautiful outputs, seamless editing.
4. Revisit after MVP success.

Original implementation plan (for future reference):
- OAuth flow for Google Sheets access
- Data fetching via Sheets API
- Schema mapping to dataset format
- Automatic refresh scheduling
- Store snapshots as datasets for AI analysis

# Test Strategy:
To be defined when feature is prioritized post-MVP. Will include:
- OAuth flow testing
- API integration testing
- Data mapping validation
- Refresh scheduling verification
