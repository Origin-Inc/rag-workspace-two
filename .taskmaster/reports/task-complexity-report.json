		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Development Environment and Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the development environment setup into discrete installation and configuration steps: Remix initialization, dependency installation, database setup with pgvector, Redis configuration, environment variables, TypeScript configuration, folder structure creation, and health check implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to multiple technologies (Remix, PostgreSQL, Redis, TypeScript) that need proper integration. Each component has specific configuration requirements and interdependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Authentication and Authorization System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide authentication system into security-focused components: database schema creation, password hashing implementation, JWT token management, authentication middleware, RBAC system, CSRF protection, rate limiting, session management, and comprehensive security testing.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to security requirements, multiple authentication flows, role-based permissions, and need for bulletproof implementation. Security vulnerabilities can be catastrophic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Core Page and Block Management System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the block system into modular components: database schema design, API route implementation, block type system, drag-and-drop functionality, positioning logic, auto-save mechanism, undo/redo system, React components for each block type, and state management integration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to real-time editing requirements, complex state management, drag-and-drop interactions, and the foundational nature affecting all other features. Requires careful architecture decisions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Database Block with Advanced Features",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 14,
			"expansionPrompt": "Segment database block into performance-critical components: schema management system, column type implementations, server-side pagination with keyset cursors, virtualization for 50k rows, CRUD operations, bulk update mechanisms, sorting/filtering systems, cell editing interfaces, and performance optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to performance requirements (50k rows), multiple column types, real-time editing, and need for enterprise-grade database functionality. Performance bottlenecks can kill the entire application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build AI Controller Sidebar with Command Processing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure AI system into processing pipeline: sidebar UI component, OpenAI API integration, Zod schema definitions for actions, command parsing logic, dry-run preview system, action validation pipeline, execution engine with rollback, audit logging, and undo functionality.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to AI integration, natural language processing, action validation, and need for reliable execution with rollback capabilities. AI responses are inherently unpredictable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement RAG System with Vector Search",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose RAG system into specialized components: document storage schema with pgvector, chunking algorithm implementation, embedding generation pipeline, vector similarity search, full-text search integration, hybrid search ranking, context retrieval optimization, and prompt engineering templates.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to advanced AI/ML concepts, vector database operations, search algorithm optimization, and performance requirements. Requires deep understanding of embeddings and retrieval strategies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Real-time Collaboration with Yjs",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break collaboration into conflict resolution components: Yjs document structure, WebSocket server setup, client-side provider configuration, awareness system for cursors, conflict resolution algorithms, snapshot persistence, offline support with IndexedDB, reconnection handling, and state synchronization.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to distributed systems challenges, CRDT algorithms, real-time synchronization, conflict resolution, and offline capabilities. One of the most technically challenging aspects of modern collaborative software."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build Background Workers and Job Queue System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure worker system into queue management components: BullMQ setup with Redis, embedding generation worker, formula computation worker, snapshot persistence worker, document indexing worker, job prioritization and retry logic, monitoring and error handling, and auto-scaling mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to distributed processing, queue management, error handling, and scalability requirements. Background workers are critical for application performance but complex to implement reliably."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Formula Engine with AI Assistance",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide formula engine into computational components: formula parser implementation, AST generation, sandboxed evaluator, built-in function library, dependency graph for incremental computation, AI formula suggestion system, validation and error handling, caching mechanisms, and performance optimization.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to language parsing, sandboxed execution security, dependency tracking, and AI integration. Formula engines are notoriously complex and performance-sensitive."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Performance Optimization and Production Readiness",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 15,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure production readiness into optimization categories: React virtualization implementation, database connection pooling, Redis caching layer, CDN configuration, comprehensive testing suite (unit/integration/e2e), monitoring setup with Sentry, CI/CD pipeline, deployment documentation, health checks, auto-scaling configuration, and performance benchmarking.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple optimization strategies, comprehensive testing requirements, deployment complexity, and production monitoring needs. Critical for application success in production."
