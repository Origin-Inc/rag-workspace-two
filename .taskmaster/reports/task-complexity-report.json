			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Core Application Layout & Navigation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the core application layout into distinct components: 1) Root layout structure with Remix routing, 2) Persistent sidebar navigation with hierarchical tree, 3) Workspace switcher dropdown with Supabase integration, 4) Breadcrumb navigation system, 5) Responsive design with mobile menu, 6) Global search with command palette (cmdk), 7) User profile menu with Supabase Auth, 8) Notification center with real-time updates, 9) Keyboard shortcuts implementation, 10) Dark/light theme toggle with persistence, 11) Navigation state management, 12) Accessibility features",
			"reasoning": "This task requires building a comprehensive application shell with multiple integrated components. The existing codebase uses Remix (not Next.js) which requires adaptation. Each component (sidebar, search, notifications, etc.) is substantial enough to be its own subtask. The hierarchical navigation tree, real-time features, and keyboard shortcuts add significant complexity."

			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Workspace Dashboard - Create comprehensive workspace dashboard UI with team management and analytics",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 14,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the workspace dashboard into focused implementation areas: 1) Dashboard grid layout system with responsive design, 2) Workspace overview component with recent items, 3) Workspace CRUD operations with Supabase, 4) Quick actions widget with document creation, 5) Team activity feed with real-time updates, 6) Usage analytics dashboard with charts (Recharts), 7) Workspace settings panel with configuration, 8) Team member invitation system with email, 9) Workspace templates gallery, 10) Global workspace search functionality, 11) Integrations panel for third-party tools, 12) Webhook management system, 13) Responsive layout optimizations, 14) Performance monitoring and optimization",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it involves building a full-featured dashboard with analytics, team management, real-time features, and multiple integrations. The usage analytics alone requires complex data visualization, while team management needs invitation flows, role management, and real-time collaboration. The integration system adds another layer of complexity."

			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Project Management System - Implement comprehensive project management within workspaces",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the project management system implementation: 1) Project data model and Supabase tables with RLS, 2) Project CRUD API routes with Remix, 3) Project dashboard component with statistics, 4) Drag-and-drop page organization (react-beautiful-dnd), 5) Project sidebar navigation with hierarchy, 6) Project search with full-text capabilities, 7) Project templates system, 8) Bulk operations on pages, 9) Project settings and permissions, 10) Project archiving and restoration",
			"reasoning": "While comprehensive, this task builds on existing patterns in the codebase. The project management system has clear boundaries and leverages existing Supabase infrastructure. The drag-and-drop functionality and hierarchical organization add complexity, but the existing database block implementation provides reference patterns."

		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Page Editor with Canvas System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 13,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement the page editor systematically: 1) Canvas grid architecture and block positioning system, 2) Block management with Supabase persistence, 3) Drag-and-drop system with @dnd-kit/sortable, 4) Block palette sidebar with categories, 5) Inline editing with ContentEditable, 6) Slash command system and menu, 7) Block selection and multi-select, 8) Copy/paste/duplicate functionality, 9) Nested blocks and column layouts, 10) Auto-save with debouncing, 11) Collaborative editing with Supabase Realtime, 12) @mentions and comments system, 13) Page properties and metadata editor",
			"reasoning": "This is highly complex as it requires building a Notion-style editor from scratch. The canvas-based positioning, real-time collaboration, slash commands, and nested block structures each represent significant technical challenges. The inline editing and content manipulation require careful state management and user experience considerations."

		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Enhanced Block System Integration",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 14,
			"expansionPrompt": "Systematically enhance the block system: 1) Grid-based positioning system with responsive breakpoints, 2) Cross-block interaction and reference system, 3) Block collections and grouping functionality, 4) Consistent theming system with variables, 5) Block permissions and access control, 6) Version control and history tracking, 7) Block transformation engine, 8) Custom block development SDK, 9) Block marketplace infrastructure, 10) Real-time collaborative editing enhancements, 11) Performance optimization with virtualization, 12) Responsive block layouts with container queries, 13) Import/export functionality for multiple formats, 14) Supabase Edge Functions integration",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task as it extends an already complex block system with advanced enterprise features. The custom SDK, marketplace, transformation engine, and version control each represent major subsystems. The performance optimization for large-scale usage and the import/export system with multiple formats add significant technical depth. Integration with Edge Functions for processing adds distributed system complexity."
