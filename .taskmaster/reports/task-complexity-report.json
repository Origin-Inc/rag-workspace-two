			"taskTitle": "MVP Pivot - Implement LLM Orchestration Layer",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 15,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the LLM Orchestration Layer implementation into focused subtasks covering: natural language intent classification, dynamic query routing between data/content/analytics sources, OpenAI Structured Outputs integration for JSON schema compliance, multi-source data aggregation, chart/visualization generation logic, response formatting for block editor integration, caching strategy for frequently asked questions, error handling and fallback mechanisms, performance optimization for sub-2-second responses, confidence scoring system, and comprehensive testing framework.",
			"reasoning": "This task has exceptional complexity (score 9) due to multiple sophisticated systems that need deep integration with existing codebase. The analysis reveals existing foundations (AI controller, OpenAI integration, RAG system, analytics query parser, database blocks, visualization components) but requires significant new development including: 1) Enhanced NLU layer beyond current command parsing, 2) Intelligent routing across Prisma queries, RAG retrieval, and analytics engine, 3) OpenAI Structured Outputs API integration (not currently implemented), 4) Dynamic visualization generation based on data patterns, 5) Complex orchestration logic to combine multiple data sources. The task touches 15+ existing services and requires careful coordination between frontend visualization components and backend AI services. The 15 subtasks reflect the need for incremental development of each major component while maintaining system stability."
