			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Build High-Performance RAG Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 15,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the RAG infrastructure implementation into focused subtasks covering: 1) pgvector index optimization with HNSW tuning, 2) Redis cache layer setup with connection pooling, 3) LRU in-memory cache implementation, 4) Multi-tier cache orchestration service, 5) BullMQ queue infrastructure setup, 6) Parallel embedding batch processor, 7) Worker implementation with OpenAI rate limiting, 8) Incremental indexing change tracking, 9) IncrementalVectorIndexer service, 10) Supabase connection pool configuration, 11) OptimizedVectorSearch implementation, 12) Prometheus monitoring integration, 13) k6 performance testing suite, 14) Cache warming strategies, 15) Admin monitoring dashboard. Each subtask should include specific implementation details, integration points, and testing requirements.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex (9/10) due to the need for extensive performance optimization across multiple layers. The codebase already has basic RAG implementation (rag.server.ts, embedding-generation.server.ts) and pgvector setup, but lacks advanced features like HNSW index tuning, multi-tier caching, parallel processing, and sub-100ms optimization. Requires deep integration with existing Supabase infrastructure, Redis setup (only basic redis.server.ts exists), BullMQ implementation (not currently used), and comprehensive monitoring. The 15 subtasks cover all critical components while maintaining manageable scope for each."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Intelligent Content Generation Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the content generation engine into subtasks: 1) Edge Function setup for content generation routing, 2) Template database schema with inheritance support, 3) Workspace pattern analysis implementation, 4) Template inheritance and variable resolution, 5) OpenAI integration for structured generation, 6) Project template generation from patterns, 7) CRM batch generation with relationships, 8) Context-aware content addition to pages, 9) Generation preview and modification system, 10) Template marketplace integration, 11) Comprehensive error handling and validation, 12) Usage analytics and monitoring. Focus on leveraging existing block system and ensuring compatibility with current database structure.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity (8/10) task requiring new Supabase Edge Functions (only oauth/webhook handlers exist currently), complex template system with inheritance, and sophisticated AI generation. The codebase has strong foundations with block system, database blocks, and OpenAI integration, but lacks template infrastructure and batch generation capabilities. Requires careful integration with existing page/block structure and maintaining real-time collaboration features. The 12 subtasks provide comprehensive coverage while building on existing patterns."

			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Build Context-Aware Response System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the context-aware system into: 1) Context models and TypeScript interfaces, 2) Intent classification with OpenAI functions, 3) Edge Function for response orchestration, 4) Page summarization with vector integration, 5) Conversational memory session management, 6) Actionable suggestion generator, 7) Workspace overview analytics, 8) Real-time context tracking hooks, 9) Response caching optimization, 10) AI Controller sidebar integration, 11) Context enrichment and cross-referencing, 12) E2E testing and monitoring setup. Build upon existing AI Controller and RAG components while adding sophisticated context understanding.",
			"reasoning": "Complex task (8/10) that extends existing AI capabilities significantly. The codebase has AI Controller sidebar and basic RAG search, but lacks context awareness, intent classification, and conversational memory. Requires new Edge Function, database schema for sessions, and deep integration with existing components. The real-time context tracking and cross-referencing add significant complexity. The 12 subtasks ensure comprehensive implementation while leveraging existing AI infrastructure."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Real-time Indexing Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the real-time indexing into: 1) Indexing queue database schema setup, 2) PostgreSQL triggers for change capture, 3) Realtime subscription service implementation, 4) Debounced batch processing logic, 5) Batch processor with concurrency control, 6) Entity-specific indexing methods, 7) Incremental indexing with checksums, 8) Background re-indexing Edge Function, 9) Performance monitoring system, 10) Intelligent cache invalidation, 11) Error handling and retry mechanisms, 12) Monitoring dashboard and analytics. Focus on building upon existing indexing-queue-worker.server.ts while adding real-time capabilities.",
			"reasoning": "Moderately complex task (7/10) that builds upon existing indexing infrastructure. The codebase already has indexing-queue-worker.server.ts and basic queue processing, but lacks real-time triggers, Supabase Realtime integration for indexing, and sophisticated batch processing. The existing auto-indexer provides a foundation, but needs enhancement for real-time updates, performance optimization, and proper monitoring. The 12 subtasks cover all aspects while leveraging existing patterns and infrastructure."
