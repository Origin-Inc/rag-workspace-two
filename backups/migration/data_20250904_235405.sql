Most AI tools, like Chat GPT, are trained on languages with substantial online resources‚Äînamely English, other European languages, and Chinese. This training bias arises because many African languages are primarily spoken rather than written, leading to a scarcity of textual data for AI training.

The Gloria funicular connects Restauradores Square in central Lisbon with the scenic Bairro Alto district, offering a brief journey of just three minutes. Uniquely, instead of relying on traditional propulsion methods, the funicular utilizes electric motors to power two cars. These cars are linked by a haulage cable, operating in such a way that the descent of one car facilitates the ascent of the other, enabling simultaneous upward and downward movement [0bb73a00-78f8-4b39-874a-9d428970bf4d].\\",\\"status\\":\\"complete\\",\\"model\\":\\"gpt-4-turbo\\",\\"tokens\\":181,\\"citations\\":[]}"}, {"id": "e134261f-6a14-4ffa-bb6e-aacf98c9c834", "type": "paragraph", "content": ""}]	üìÑ	\N	\N	\N	0	f	f	2025-09-04 10:04:54.289+00	2025-09-04 10:47:37.949381+00

Ned Sampson, the new editor of an Ohio newspaper pointedly called The Toledo Truth Teller. That goal, he says, was "much more noble and much more achievable". Domhnall Gleeson makes Ned earnest and engaging as the centre of this charming, smart, thoroughly winning spin-off of the US version of The Office. The creators of The Paper ‚Äì including Greg Daniels, who adapted the American Office from the British original ‚Äì have found the magic formula for making an offshoot work. The new show is the same only different. It has the DNA, droll humour and sharp mock-documentary style of The Office. There is a similar ensemble of characters, down-to-earth enough to seem authentic and exaggerated enough to be comic. But it is also distinctly itself, reflecting how the world has changed in the 20 years since the US version began.\n\nsummarize this page\n\nLisbon's Gloria funicular has become the subject of several investigations from authorities following the crash that has killed at least 16 people.We've taken a closer look at the funicular, and answered some key questions:Where does it go?The Gloria funicular travels from Restauradores, a square in the middle of Lisbon, up to the picturesque area of Bairro Alto. It takes just three minutes to travel one-way.How does it operate?Unlike traditional funiculars, the two cars on the Gloria funicular are powered by electric motors.They are attached to opposite ends of a haulage cable meaning that as one travels downhill, its weight lifts the other, allowing them to ascend and descend simultaneously.	1	{"pageId": "8e182e5a-3608-46ec-9ec4-3172ac309974", "headers":

Mr Roberts-Smith lost an appeal against that judgement and was ordered to pay the newspapers' legal costs.Mr Roberts-Smith, who left the defence force in 2013, has not been charged over any of the claims in a criminal court where there is a higher burden of proof.\n\nTwenty years on from its premiere, The US Office remains hugely popular comedy comfort food ‚Äì and this follow-up series, set around an Ohio newspaper, deserves to be just as big a hit.What kind of child wanted to be Clark Kent instead of Superman? Ned Sampson, the new editor of an Ohio newspaper pointedly called The Toledo Truth Teller. That goal, he says, was "much more noble and much more achievable". Domhnall Gleeson makes Ned earnest and engaging as the centre of this charming, smart, thoroughly winning spin-off of the US version of The Office. The creators of The Paper ‚Äì including Greg Daniels, who adapted the American Office from the British original ‚Äì have found the magic formula for making an offshoot work. The new show is the same only different. It has the DNA, droll humour and sharp mock-documentary style of The Office. There is a similar ensemble of characters, down-to-earth enough to seem authentic and exaggerated enough to be comic. But it is also distinctly itself, reflecting how the world has changed in the 20 years since the US version began.	2	{"pageId": "8e182e5a-3608-46ec-9ec4-3172ac309974", "headers": ["notes"],

It provides insights into the funicular's route and operational mechanics. The Gloria funicular connects Restauradores Square in central Lisbon with the scenic Bairro Alto district, offering a brief journey of just three minutes. Uniquely, instead of relying on traditional propulsion methods, the funicular utilizes electric motors to power two cars. These cars are linked by a haulage cable, operating in such a way that the descent of one car facilitates the ascent of the other, enabling simultaneous upward and downward movement

Despite Africa's linguistic diversity, with the continent being home to over a quarter of the world's languages, there's a notable gap in AI development due to insufficient investment and the lack of readily available data. Most AI tools, including those like Chat GPT, are predominantly trained on languages with extensive online text resources such as English, other European languages, and Chinese. This leaves many African languages out of the loop primarily because they are oral rather than written, which results in a scarcity of textual data to train AI systems. Consequently, millions of people across Africa are excluded from benefiting from AI technologies [fc73c0a7-bf2d-4068-8125-b2f5c722c427].\n\n2. **Estonia's Bogs and Their Cultural and Ecological Significance**: The page also explores the importance of Estonia's bogs, which cover a fifth of the country and are deeply interwoven with its culture and ecology. Historically seen as mystical places, these bogs are now accessible for exploration through guided bog-shoe treks. The narrative details a personal experience of walking on the spongy peatland with the help of bog shoes, which distribute a person's weight to prevent sinking. This segment vividly describes the unique landscape of the K√µnnu Suursoo bog, emphasizing its ecological value and the immersive experience it offers to visitors [fc73c0a7-bf2d-4068-8125-b2f5c722c427].\n\nOverall, the page highlights critical issues in technological development and cultural-ecological preservation, showcasing the challenges of global inclusivity in AI technology and the beauty and significance of natural landscapes in Estonia.	1	{"pageId": "f7ace402-1411-4c31-a6c0-fb4673fc11c2", "hasList": true, "headers": ["holo"], "position":
